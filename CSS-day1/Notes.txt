# 10-Day CSS & Bootstrap Crash Course

Great! Let's learn CSS and Bootstrap together over the next 10 days. I'll start with the fundamentals and build up to more advanced concepts, with examples for each.

## Day 1: CSS Basics & Selectors

### 1. CSS Syntax
CSS has a simple syntax: selector + declaration block.

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

### 2. Basic Selectors
```css
/* Element selector */
p {
  color: blue;
}

/* Class selector */
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}

/* ID selector */
#main-title {
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

### Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  /* Element selector */
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
  
  /* Class selector */
  .highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
  
  /* ID selector */
  #main-title {
    font-size: 24px;
    color: red;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 id="main-title">Welcome to CSS!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph with blue text.</p>
  <p class="highlight">This paragraph has a yellow background.</p>
  <div class="highlight">This div also has a yellow background.</div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Practice Task:
1. Create an HTML file with:
   - A heading with ID "header"
   - 3 paragraphs, one with class "important"
   - A div with class "important"
2. Add CSS to:
   - Make the header green
   - Make all paragraphs have font-size 18px
   - Give the "important" class a red border

Would you like me to continue with Day 2 (Box Model) after you've practiced this, or would you like to dive deeper into selectors first?
